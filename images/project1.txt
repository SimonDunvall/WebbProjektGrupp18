Hiphopology is a text mining tool that handles data for the partial discographies of my top 50 hip-hop artists. Some of my favourite artists had to be discluded due to the strict criteria I was following to maintain a constant between the datasets for each artists (eg. every artists included in this list must have at least 5 full length projects released). The data is mined from all the verses (lyrics in bridges, refrains, hooks, choruses, feature verses, etc. were not taken into account) on each project from each artist. This tool is not meant to compare artists, only to better understand the work and process of each artist as an individual.
